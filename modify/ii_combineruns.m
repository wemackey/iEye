% datasets provided in ii_trial and adds label info, all returned as
% ii_expt
%
%   ii_combineruns(ii_trial), where ii_trial is a cell array of
%   scored runs (using ii_scoreMGS or similar) concatenates all trials.
%   Assumes that runs are numbers 1-n, where n is length(ii_trial). If
%   ii_trial is a struct, ii_sess is returned as ii_trial, and run is
%   labeled as 1.
%
%   ii_combineruns(ii_trial,run_labels) where run_labels is the same
%   length as ii_trial saves a label for each run such that ii_trial{i} is
%   labeled with run_labels(i).
%
% uses cat_struct.m (TCS)
%
% We assume that ii_trial.params is the same for all runs, so we only save
% the first one. 
%
% No ii_cfg input/output necessary - ii_cfg mostly links data from trials
% to ii_data, but that won't be necessary anymore, at least not here.
